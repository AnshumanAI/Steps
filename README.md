# Textbook Content Extraction and RAG System
This project extracts content from textbooks, creates hierarchical indexes, implements hybrid retrieval techniques, and develops a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering questions based on the retrieved content.

## Requirements
* Python 3.7+
* transformers
* rank_bm25
* PyMuPDF
* nltk

## Usage
### Step 1: Text Extraction
Extract content from PDF textbooks.

### Step 2: Hierarchical Tree Indexing
Create hierarchical tree-based indexes from the extracted content.

### Step 3: Retrieval Techniques
Implement and test BM25, DPR, and hybrid retrieval techniques.

### Step 4: Multi-document RAG
Combine the retrieval techniques to handle multiple documents and sections.

### Step 5: Question Answering
Integrate a language model to generate answers based on the retrieved content.

## Running the Notebook
Copy and execute the Jupyter notebook to perform each step sequentially, Don't forget to add your Books.
